# 🔧 ESP32-C3 IoT Development Board – Designed with KiCad 8

This repository showcases the complete design journey of a **medium-complexity, four-layer IoT development board**, created using **KiCad 8**. The board features the **ESP32-C3** microcontroller along with built-in **environmental sensors**, **flash memory**, **microSD card support**, and a robust **power management system**—making it a powerful and flexible platform for modern IoT applications.

Unlike previous KiCad projects where I only explored new features, this time I set out to **test KiCad 8 in a real-world design workflow**—from schematic to layout, all the way to manufacturing and hardware validation. The result is this versatile, fully functional development board, designed, tested, and optimized using KiCad 8's latest capabilities.
